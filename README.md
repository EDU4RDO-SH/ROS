This entire repository should be cloned to: ```~/catkin_ws/src``` (assuming your ros workspace is named ```catkin_ws``` and resides within your home directory). To do so, navigate to ```~/catkin_ws/src``` from a terminal and enter: ```git clone https://github.com/EDU4RDO-SH/ROS.git```. Then, from a terminal, navigate to ```~/catkin_ws``` and compile the code with the command: ```catkin_make```.

If you are installing ROS for the first time, see the instructions [here](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu).
